# PHP All Basic Programs

## Details

  * Each file(program) represents single program in PHP language. 
  * I will add more basic programs in upcoming days.

## Requirements

You can separately install Web Server, PHP Interpreter, and MySQL databases, but to make work easier, developers have made all in one setup package called WAMP, LAMP, MAMP and XAMPP which will automatically install and set up PHP environment on your Windows, Linux or MAC machines.
